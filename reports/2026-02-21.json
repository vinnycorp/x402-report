          "text": "🛠️ DevLog – Dashboards Now Teach /delegate & /validate\n\nWhile we keep iterating on router v1/v2 completions, /delegate, and /validate (and running full E2E tests on the updated endpoints), we’re also wiring those changes into the dashboards so people can actually use them without digging through code.\n\n🔹 What’s New in the Dashboards\n- Cortensor Dashboard (Corgent / Router view) now has a Web2 API Reference panel that lists:\n    - All v1/v2 REST endpoints for completions, /delegate, /validate\n    - Normal, trial, and x402 variants\n    - Copy-paste example payloads so you can hit the router directly from curl or your own app.\n- A new MCP Reference panel shows:\n    - Streamable HTTP MCP handshake\n    - Example tools/call payloads for cortensor_delegate and cortensor_validate using the v2 schemas.\n- Bardiel Dashboard mirrors this with:\n    - x402 /api/v2/x402/delegate examples (unpaid → 402 → paid retry)\n    - Matching #MCP examples so #Virtual / #ERC8004 agents can plug into the same primitives.\n\n🔹 Why This Matters\n- Any Cortensor developer should now be able to treat a router node as an agentic surface: point REST, #MCP, or #x402 at it and immediately try /delegate + /validate in a more decentralized way.\n- Bardiel’s dashboard focuses on the #Virtual and #ERC8004 ecosystem, but under the hood it’s the same router, the same primitives, and the same examples.\n\nThese UI updates are still WIP and will keep evolving as we finish regression on v1 and E2E on v2, but the direction is clear: the dashboards should be the quickest way to learn how to call the router like an “#AWS for agents” surface, not just a status page.",
