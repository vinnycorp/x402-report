**ACTION ITEMS**

🔧 x402-api-server (fernsugi) - Spin up DeFi data endpoints if you're building agent trading or analysis—ready to go on Base with micropayments
💰 MoonPay/Circle agent stack - Major infrastructure plays landing now; watch for developer tooling announcements and protocol expansion to Solana
📈 Virtuals ACP A2A volume - 99% of x402 demand comes from agent-to-agent services; if you're building APIs or tools, price in micropayments, not subscriptions
⚠️ Chokepoint risk (Coinbase flow routing) - x402 processes $600M annually but relies heavily on CoinbaseCOIN for liquidity; decentralized routing solutions needed long-term
