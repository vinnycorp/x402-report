The criteria require passing a rigid Journal Entry Test (JET) to verify structural integrity. Target baselayer assets are evaluated against the Adversarial Logic Layer to ensure the execution thesis is immune to DJZS-I02 (NARRATIVE_DEPENDENCY) and DJZS-I01 (FOMO_LOOP). A Tier-1 designation is only granted if the asset demonstrates verifiable on-chain utility, immutable consensus mechanisms, and the required liquidity depth to execute low-leverage exposure without structural execution failure. \"Vibes\" are discarded; only deterministic, machine-verifiable logic traces are accepted.\n\n2. Integration of x402 Payment Middleware on Base Mainnet\nThe x402 payment middleware functions as the mandatory API tollbooth and economic rail for the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) economy. Integration is executed as a strict \"Audit-Before-Act\" gateway. Before any execution agent is authorized to commit a LONG exposure or deploy capital to the ledger, it must submit its reasoning trace to the DJZS protocol and remit the required fee via the x402 middleware on Base Mainnet.\n\nIf the logic trace is validated without triggering Structural (S) or Epistemic (E) failure codes, the middleware authorizes the transaction and issues a cryptographically signed Proof-of-Logic Certificate. If the agent exhibits circular reasoning or narrative drift, the x402 authorization is denied, the sequence is automatically aborted, and treasury capital is preserved.",

Predictive \"vibes-based\" directional guessing is explicitly rejected by the protocol. The Adversarial Logic Layer audits structural execution probability and risk asymmetry.\n\n**Adversarial Logic Scan: Short Exposure Vectors**\nAttempting to short current Top Gainers (`POWER` at +35.35%, `GWEI` at +26.46%) introduces infinite risk asymmetry. A strategic payload attempting to short momentum-driven, narrative-heavy assets fails the JET audit due to severe squeeze probability.\n*Action:* Aborted. Triggers `DJZS-X01 (EXECUTION_LIQUIDITY_RISK)`.\n\n**Adversarial Logic Scan: Long Exposure Vectors**\nAllocating long positions into the aforementioned Top Gainers mathematically triggers `DJZS-I01 (FOMO_LOOP)`. The logic trace of buying a 35% intraday pump is structurally unsound and guarantees treasury decay over a sufficient time horizon.\n*Action:* Aborted. Triggers `DJZS-I01 (FOMO_LOOP)`.\n\n**Deterministic Execution Pathway**\nThe only structurally sound directional payloads mathematically verified by the current liquidity clusters on Blofin are risk-managed **LONG** exposures on Tier-1 baselayer assets:\n\n* **[BTCUSDT Perp](https://blofin.com/futures/BTC-USDT)**: Demonstrates $370.91M in 24h volume. Deep structural liquidity absorbs execution without severe slippage.\n* **[ETHUSDT Perp](https://blofin.com/futures/ETH-USDT)**: Demonstrates $108.35M in 24h volume.\n\nThe verified logic trace for capital preservation authorizes a low-leverage LONG payload on `BTC/USDT` or `ETH/USDT`. Shorting the current market structure lacks mathematical safety loops.\n\nExecution agent is halted.
